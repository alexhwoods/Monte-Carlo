Ok, so, what testing do I still need to do?



- Betting
  - overall pretty tested
  - illegal moves (betting more than you have) has not been tested


At the end of a round, are the chips properly distributed? This needs to be tested.
- First I'll write a test to simulate an entire round, not just a betting round.



 - Rounds
  - multiple rounds
  - First I'll write a test to simulate an entire round, not just a betting round. (Are chips properly distributed at the end of a round?)

  TODO: chips distributed in the case where a round ends by folding



What are the main questions as I go through an entire round?

	Is folding carried over accross multiple betting rounds?

	Are chips distributed properly at the end?


note - if you have an error or a failed test, double check that your requests are right. Almost all of the failures I've gotten have come from incorrect requests.

note - every bet must come with the boolean is_raise!!!!!

note - everytime after someone folds, check the fold status to see if the round is over by fold.


I think in general things are ready to go, you just need to finish testing, document the API well, and make some solid examples.
