# Monte Carlo

Poker AI

A url will be released soon to visit the web-app.



## Development

See the API [documentation](https://alexhwoods.github.io/slate/).

## Installation 

1. Clone the repo.
2. In the main directory, run 
```sh
	pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the server, run the following command.
```sh
sh bin/start_server.sh
```
If you want to make this easier on yourself in the future, put these 2 lines in your .profile file in your home directory.
```sh
alias mc='cd ~/path/to/monte-carlo'
alias mc-start='mc; sh bin/start_server.sh'
```
and then restart terminal, and you can simply run 'mc-start' to start the server.
