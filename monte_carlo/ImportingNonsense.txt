I think at this point you've resolved the issues, but I wouldn't be surprised if more import issues come up...because it's Python.

If you get:
ImportError Cannot import NAME

Try running the file at the same time.


ImportError No module named

- Try the solution found in basic.py, using sys.path.append(...).

This is the one that sucks. At this point components is a module, but I'm not sure what I have to do in order to make other things modules. I've added them to the python paths, etc. It's a mess!
