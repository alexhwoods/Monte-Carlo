# Notes to future self on user interface

1. Be sure to only present the user with valid betting options. If you 
only present them with valid options, it eliminates a whole bunch of 
filters you have to put in. This means no text boxes, etc. Buttons that 
will be disabled in certain scenarios and sliders that will only allow
players to raise within a certain range.

2. Raises are kind of handled right now with the little command line
thing, but for them to really be handled, players will need to be able
to raise until they can't. A betting round should be able to go on for 
a long time if the players desire, it's very while loop-ish.

3. A lot of stuff revolving around poker and Las Vegas is super trashy
and gives a lowlife feeling. Make sure to make the user interface classy,
minimalist and well done.
